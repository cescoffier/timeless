# Timeless

Opinionated, flexible but pragmatic way to try conquer the many inboxes in a Red Hatter's life.

## Setup

- Get a todoist account and grab API token
    - pre-create projects: Talks, Reading List
- Get a github account and grab API token
- Setup a google project on google cloud platform (public google not red hat as it won't have access to public gmail)
    - Enable GMail API, Google Calendar Api and Google Drive API
    - Download credentials.json from https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/people.googleapis.com/credentials into
      root of timeless and rename it into `credentials-<name-of-account>, for example `credentials-redhat.json` or `
      credentials-personal.json`
- Get pocket account and create an app to get consumer token and
  use https://reader.fxneumann.de/plugins/oneclickpocket/auth.php to get access token

## Build and run timeless

`mvn package`

Copy `timeless-example.yaml` to `timeless.yaml` (put it next to credentials-<name-of-account>.json)

`java -Dquarkus.config.locations=timeless.yaml -jar target/timeless-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

## Hints

For each task created by timeless, you can provide a _hint_ to automatically configure the project and the section for
the task.

Hints are configured as follows:

```yaml
hints:
  # Keywords: to match against the task content (title), comma separated list
  # Project: the name of the project to assign the task to, must exist in Todoist
  # Section: the name of the section to assign the task to, must exist in Todoist (optional)
  - keywords: Clement / Thomas Sync, Quarkus Team call
    project: "â˜• - Quarkus"
    section: "ðŸ“† - Meetings"

  - keywords: https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-reactive-messaging
    project: "ðŸš§ -  Messaging"
```

If inbox cleanup is enabled (using `todoist.cleanup-enabled: true`), hints are applied to each task from the inbox. 
If a task matches a hint, it is assigned to the project and section specified in the hint.


## Reading list manager 

Timeless can be used to manage your reading list. It will create a task for each item in the reading list. It currently supports the soon defunct Pocket and Instapaper.

### Pocket

To use Pocket, you need to create an app on the Pocket website and get your consumer key and access token. You can then configure Timeless to use Pocket by adding the following to your `timeless.yaml`:

```yaml
pocket:
  enabled: true # False by default, set to true to enable Pocket integration
  consumer-key: <your-consumer-key>
  access-token: <your-access-token>
  limit: 100 # Max number of item in the reading list before it adds a taks to curate the reading list
```
Pocket uses the `Reading List` project to create tasks for the items in the reading list. That project must exist in Todoist.


### Instapaper

To use Instapaper, you need to create an app on the Instapaper website and get your consumer key and consumer secret. You can then configure Timeless to use Instapaper by adding the following to your `timeless.yaml`:

```yaml
instapaper:
  enabled: true # False by default, set to true to enable Instapaper integration
  consumer-id: <your-consumer-id>
  consumer-secret: <your-consumer-secret>
  username: <your-instapaper-username>
  password: <your-instapaper-password>
```

Instapaper uses the `Reading List` project to create tasks for the items in the reading list. That project must exist in Todoist. You can configure the project name using the `instapaper.reading-list-project` property in `timeless.yaml`.

You can also configure the `instapaper.limit` property to specify the maximum number of items in the reading list before it adds a task to curate the reading list.
